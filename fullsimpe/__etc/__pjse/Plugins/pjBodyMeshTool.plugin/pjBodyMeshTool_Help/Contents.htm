<p align="left">This tool is to help with the previously very tedious parts of 
extracting and linking a mesh ready for making a new clothing, hair, or 
accessory mesh for your Sims.&nbsp; Tutorials to help with the task overall may 
be found in many places, including

<p align="left"><font size="4">Installing</font></p>
<p align="left">If your installation was not already part of SimPE, or you are 
picking up a new version from the
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.simlogical.com">Simlogical 
website</a> then install as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  <p align="left">Unpack the zip and drop the enclosed &quot;Plugins&quot; folder into 
  your SimPE program folder.&nbsp; &nbsp;This should mix the new plugins in with any you 
  already have in your existing plugins folder there.&nbsp; &nbsp;That is the correct 
  result.&nbsp; &nbsp;People who have downloaded earlier version of this will be asked if 
  it is ok to overwrite existing files?&nbsp; Yes it is.</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Extracting mesh parts</font></p>
<p align="left">This takes care of finding and extracting and importing those 
four mesh files from the Sims0x.package files, in a fraction of the time it used 
to take.&nbsp; This assumes you have already made the outfit (or hair etc) in 
Bodyshop cloned from the outfit you want to base your new mesh on.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  <p align="left">Open SimPE, and start a new file, using 
  <font face="Arial Narrow">File|New</font></li>
  <li>
  <p align="left">Use menu option <font face="Arial Narrow">Tools|PJSE|Body Mesh Tool|Extracting stage</font>, 
  and browse to the outfit package you already made in Bodyshop that you wanted 
  to base your new mesh on.</li>
  <li>
  <p align="left">You should soon see the 4 files appearing (or more if you had 
  more than one Propertyset or XMOL in your Bodyshop file)&nbsp; NB the new file has 
  not been saved at this point.</li>
  <li>
  <p align="left">You are now ready to continue the normal process from the bit 
  where you have to Fix Integrity.</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left"><font size="4">Linking mesh parts to Bodyshop file</font></p>
<p align="left">This part is instead of where you would extract the Shape and 
Resource node resources, add them to the Bodyshop package, add them to the 3IDR 
list then delete them again.</p>
<ol>
  <li>
  <p align="left">Open your Bodyshop file</li>
  <li>
  <p align="left">Open the relevant 3IDR resource (there may be several for 
  accessories)</li>
  <li>
  <p align="left">Use menu option <font face="Arial Narrow">Tools|PJSE|Body Mesh Tool|Linking</font> stage, 
  ensuring you didn't have any edits waiting to be saved, as they may be lost 
  after linking.&nbsp; &nbsp;Browse to your mesh file and click OK</li>
  <li>
  <p align="left">After the tool tells you it completed, close your 3IDR 
  resource <b>without Committing</b> by selecting another resource to open.&nbsp; 
  &nbsp;The linking should now be complete, and you should save your file.&nbsp; If you 
  wish, you may reopen the 3IDR first to satisfy yourself the right changes were 
  made.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
