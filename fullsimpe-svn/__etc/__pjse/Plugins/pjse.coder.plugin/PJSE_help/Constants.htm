<p align="center"><b><font size="5">Constants Overview</font></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">Constants are used for easy tuning of behaviour.&nbsp; Instead 
of entering the literal value in each BHAV that uses it, you can specify it once 
in a Constant, and reference that value from any BHAV that needs it.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
For example, Maxis use a constant to hold the time of day that a teenager should 
go home after a visit, and call to that constant anywhere in the game where it 
needs to be decided whether or not a teen can be seen away from his home lot.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
A modder can change the value in that one place and it will affect the whole 
game.</p>
<p align="left">The values are held in the BCON resources, and you may add 
labels to help you remember what they represent in the TRCN resource that has 
the matching instance number.&nbsp; It is completely optional to have a TRCN 
resource, but if you do have one, PJSE will show that label when you are editing 
the BCON and any BHAV that uses it.</p>
