SimPE is a tool that can be used to do indeep changes to the internal data of "The Sims 2".

Many people have used SimPE without problems. However, if you are not careful, this tool can damage your game or even your system. Do not use SimPE if you don't want to take that risk! Remember: SimPE is in it's alpha stage!

We strongly advise to make a working backup copy of "My Documents\EA Games\The Sims 2" before you start SimPE.

To execute SimPE you need Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=0856eacb-4362-4b0d-8edd-aab15c5e04f5&displaylang=en)

For the "Wizards of SimPE" and "Photo Studio" to work you also need to install the "Colour Options Enabler" package ("CEP", http://sims.ambertation.de/cep.shtml). Since a few releases the default templates for the PhotoStudio will not be shipped with SimPE. When you first start it, SimPE will offer to install the templates via the internet.

In order to get better results for the texture compression, you should install the "Nvidia DDS Utilities" (http://developer.nvidia.com/object/nv_texture_tools.html).
