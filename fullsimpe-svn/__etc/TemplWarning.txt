This Setup will install some Templates for the SimPE PhotoStudio.

Most of the templates were not created by me, they were created by Deedee, Pinhead, Galcier1701 and Havelock.

For the "Photo Studio" to work correct, you also need to install the Colour Options Enabler Package (http://sims.ambertation.de/cep.shtml).

In order to get better Result for the Texture Compression in the PhotoStudio, you should install teh "Nvidia DDS utilities" (http://developer.nvidia.com/object/nv_texture_tools.html) and set up the Path to it in the Extra->Options Window.
