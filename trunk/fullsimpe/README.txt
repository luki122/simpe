The SimPE project contains several Projects (Solutions), which are stored in the __Solutions Subfolder.

If you simply want to compile the main SimPE Application, you have to open __Solutions\SimPE.sln 
with VisualStudio 2005 (Express) or SharpDevelop 2, and hit compile.
 
!!!!! Remember, you need to Install the Microsoft MANAGED DirectX9 Summer 2004 SDK, in order to compile some parts of SimPE !!!!!
