<h1>PJ ObjKey Tool Help</h1>

<p>This tool is designed to gather all the resources for an object into a single package
to make it easier to customise.  It's based on wes_h's tutorial on making 
<a id="l01" href="http://forums.modthesims2.com/showthread.php?t=208775">custom
collars</a> and uses the same terms as that, i.e. ObjKey, FragKey, BinKey, etc.</p>

<p>You have to decide on an object to work on from Skins.package.
Other .package files may or may not work...<p>

<p>Extract the overlay (GZPS, XMOL, XTOL) or matching index (3IDR) into a new .package.
For example, ducollarsmooth_bonesyellow XMOL or 3IDR.  Open the new package and
select the resource you put in it.</p>

<p>Then you click on Tools, PJSE, ObjKey Tool and wait whilst it hunts for
<ol>
<li>the matching other half of the ObjKey</li>
<li>all the FragKeys that reference the ObjKey</li>
<li>the BinKeys for those FragKeys</li>
<li>the string resources for the BinKeys and FragKeys</li>
<li>the rcol chain hanging off the ObjKey, including TXMTs, TXTRs and LIFOs</li>
</ol>
These are all imported into the open package.</p>
<p>Then it's back to you to customise the object.</p>
