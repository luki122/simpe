SimPE is a tool that can be used to change the internal data of "The Sims 2".

Many people have used SimPE without problems. However, if you are not careful this tool can damage your game or even your system.  Do not use SimPE if you don't want to take that risk!  Remember SimPE is in its alpha stage!

Please make sure you have a working backup copy of "My Documents\EA Games\The Sims 2" before you start SimPE.

You need Microsoft .NET 1.1 (http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=262d25e3-f589-4842-8157-034d1e7cf3a3&displaylang=en) to execute SimPE.

For the "Wizards of SimPE" and "Photo Studio" to work you also need to install the Colour Options Enabler Package (http://sims.ambertation.de/cep.shtml). From this Release on, SimPE will not ship with default Templates 
for the PhotoStudio. When you first start it, SimPE will offer you to install the Templates.

In order to get better Result for the Texture Compression, you should install teh "Nvidia DDS utilities" (http://developer.nvidia.com/object/nv_texture_tools.html).
