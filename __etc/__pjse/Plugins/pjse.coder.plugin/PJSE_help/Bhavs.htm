<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Behaviour functions (BHAVs) contain the code that controls in a detailed way what 
will happen when a Sim goes about his life.&nbsp; They cover everything from how 
he handles the current object to what happens when he starves to death.&nbsp; 
From NightLife onwards, some of the behaviour is scripted in LUA scripts, which 
can be called from BHAVs.</p>
<p>To make your work easier, you may choose to provide labels for the Local 
Variables and Parameters declared in a BHAV by setting up an optional 
corresponding TPRP resource.&nbsp; Maxis did not include these with their 
distributed packages, probably to save file size.</p>
