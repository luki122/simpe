<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PJSE Filetable does not coincide with the SimPE filetable exactly.&nbsp; 
PJSE does understand your latest EP or SP installation via the SimPE settings, 
but not the extra paths you define in SimPE.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is so that it 
doesn't waste memory on resources that are not connected with Simantics editing.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Extra paths and/or individual files can be defined to PJSE via 
\&lt;SimpePath&gt;\Data\Plugins\pjse.coder.plugin\packages.txt (<i>case sensitive</i>).&nbsp; 
You can create the folder and file if they do not already exist.</p>
<p>Use one fresh line for each path or file defined.&nbsp; Typical lines in 
packages.txt would look like the following</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber5">
  <tr>
    <td width="64%">C:\Documents and Settings\Inge Jones\My Documents\EA 
    Games\The Sims 2\Downloads\</td>
    <td width="36%">Loose packages in Downloads</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="64%">C:\Documents and Settings\Inge Jones\My Documents\EA 
    Games\The Sims 2\Downloads\+</td>
    <td width="36%">All packages in Downloads including those in subfolders</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="64%">C:\Documents and Settings\Inge Jones\My 
    Documents\WorkInProgress\CurrentProject\+</td>
    <td width="36%">All packages and folders under a particular project folder</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="64%">C:\Documents and Settings\Inge Jones\My 
    Documents\WorkInProgress\HandyResources.package</td>
    <td width="36%">A particular package file</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Please note we use a + to mean recurse, so it does not get confused with the 
more ambiguous *</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font size="4">Why would you want to define these extra paths and files?</font></p>
<p>Most people will never feel the need to do this at all, but some of the 
benefits are:</p>
<p>1. If you have created new semiglobals or globals that your current project 
needs to use (rare, but I have needed to do this on a couple of complex 
projects), and PJSE can find the package containing them via its filetable, you 
won't be told &quot;invalid BHAV&quot; on the line you call those globals from - it will 
be able to display the name and show you how many parameters the called BHAV 
expects etc.</p>
<p>2. Maxis did not distribute most of their BCON labels with objects.package.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
People are finding out what various BCONs mean and are creating their own TRCN 
resources (BCON label files).&nbsp; These can be placed as packages in a folder 
named by packages.txt, and then PJSE will use them to automatically display the 
meaning of the BCON wherever it appears in the file you have open.&nbsp; There 
are other types of label files such as one for local variables and parameters 
(TPRP) which this applies to also.</p>
<p>If one of the PJSE plugins is not showing some resources you expect it to, 
then usually clicking the <b>RFT</b> (stands for Refresh File Table) button on 
the top bar of your plugin window will put that right.&nbsp; Please remember 
this is not the same as the overall SimPE filetable refresh option which is 
found elsewhere on the menus.</p>
