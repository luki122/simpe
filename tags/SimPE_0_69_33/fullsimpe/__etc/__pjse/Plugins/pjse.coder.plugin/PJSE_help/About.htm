<p>PJSE stands for Peter Jones' Simantics Editor.&nbsp; It is a collection of 
plugins for <a href="http://sims.ambertation.de/">SimPE</a> which provide 
enhanced features above those available in the built-in editors.&nbsp; When you 
install SimPE, it is set to install PJSE plugins by default, and those will be 
the ones you automatically get while using SimPE unless you disable them or 
untick the option during installation.</p>
<p>Please remember SimPE itself is still in Alpha stage, which means these 
plugins should be regarded as Alpha too.&nbsp; For those who don't know what 
that means, it means unless you consider yourself to be technically literate, or 
happy to undertake adventures, you should not use it.</p>
<p>The editors covered by PJSE currently are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>BCON - Behaviour constants</li>
  <li>TRCN - Behaviour constant labels</li>
  <li>BHAV - Behaviour functions</li>
  <li>TPRP - Behaviour function labels for Parameters passed in and Local 
  Variables</li>
  <li>STR# - Textlist files</li>
  <li>CTSS - Build/Buy catalog object name and description</li>
  <li>TTAB - Pie Menu function list and attraction settings</li>
  <li>TTAs - Pie Menu labels</li>
  <li>OBJf - Object Functions table</li>
</ul>

<p>PJSE comes with credit to Quaxi for SimPE, Dizzy2 and Shy and probably others 
for the DisaSim parsing details, DatGen team for some data info, especially 
Breon for the Wiki entries, and everyone who has patiently helped with testing.<br>
